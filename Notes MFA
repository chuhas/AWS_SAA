Notes:

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
  -Factors:
    -Knowledge: "Something you know" ie Usernames & Passwords
    -Possession: "Something you have" ie Bank card or MFA device/app
    -Inherent: Somthing you are" ie fingerprint or facial recognition
    -Location: "Somewhere you are" ie physical location or which network you're logged into
    -Multiple factors make it more secure, but less convenient
  -AWS MFA
    -Usually requires 2x Knowledge (user name + password) and Possesion (Virtual MFA device token/code authenticator - which usually has MFA ie username, password, and inherent (face/finger))
    -Setup MFA (root user - Use new entry for additional accounts or identities)
      -Account drop down (upper right)
