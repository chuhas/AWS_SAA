Identity and Access Managemant (IAM)
  -Globally persistant core AWS service
  -Has the same permissions as the root user (except billing and account closure)
    -Create and manage identities and thier permissions.
    -IAM identities start with no permissions on an AWS Account, but can be granted permissions (almost) up to those held by the Account Root User
    -IAM allows the creation of 3 different types of identity objects
      -Users, Groups, and Roles
        -Users: Humans or applications that need access to the account
        -Groups: Collection of related users (Accounting, HR, Developers)
        -Roles: Used for AWS services or external access to the account
  -Least Privilege Access: limits users' access rights to only what are strictly required to do their jobs
    -Users, Groups, and applications
